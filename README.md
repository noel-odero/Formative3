# Formative 3 – Probability Distributions, Bayesian Probability, and Gradient Descent

**Group Members:** Angie Noel, Modestine Nformi, Sharif Kiviiri, Josephine Kanu


This repository contains implementations for four different analytical tasks:
1) working with a **bivariate normal distribution** and visualising probability densities,
2) applying **Bayes’ Theorem**,
3) implementing **Gradient Descent for Multiple Variables**.
4) Code version of the **Gradient Descent**

Each part is self-contained in its own folder.

## Part 1: Bivariate Normal Distribution

- We defined a bivariate normal PDF with means, variances and correlation.
- We generated a probability density surface and contour plots.
- We demonstrated how different correlation values affect the joint PDF shape.

## Part 2: Bayes’ Probability

Implementation of Bayes’ Theorem and demonstration with example values.

We showed how posterior probability changes based on prior + evidence likelihood and illustrated the difference between P(A|B) and P(B|A).

This implementation shows how Bayes’ Theorem bridges statistics and natural language processing (NLP).
By quantifying the relationship between keywords and sentiment, we gain interpretable, data-driven insights into how language patterns reflect human opinions

Each bar represents how strongly a word predicts a positive review.

## Part 4: Gradient Descent for Multiple Variables

- We implemented multivariate linear regression using **vectorized gradient descent**.
- We ran 4 iterations to illustrate update steps.
- Then we used SciPy to verify correctness.
